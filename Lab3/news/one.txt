Elon Musk has deleted the Facebook pages of SpaceX and Tesla, apparently because he was dared to.

Mr Musk claimed that he wasn't aware that his companies had pages on the site and that he would remove them. Soon after, both pages disappeared â€“ taking their combined more than 5 million likes with them.

The deletion came after a conversation in which Mr Musk responded to a post by WhatsApp's co-founder that called on people to delete Facebook. "What's Facebook?" Mr Musk wrote.
